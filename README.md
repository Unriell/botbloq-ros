# botbloq-ros
Ros program to control modular robots

## Best practices to maintain this repo
* Use develop branch to upload unstable code and master branch only after integration tests.
* The repo will be structured in ROS packages or stacks.
* Use English for packages names and code preferably.
* Use only relative paths inside your code so that it can be used in other computers.
* Specify your code's dependencies (i.e. make sure your package.xml file contains all the dependencies your code needs).
* Include a README file in your package with instructions on how to use it.
